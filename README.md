A [React](https://reactjs.org/) app that displays random beer & brewery information retrieved from the [BreweryDB API](https://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs).

<br>

### Requirements:

-   the **_npm_** package manager to be able to install the required dependencies

<br>

### Instructions:

1) Install the dependencies by executing the following CLI command in the project's root directory:

`npm i`

2) Create a file in the root directory of the project with the following name:

`.env.local`

3) In the file created above, add the following variable and paste a valid Brewery DB API key instead of the ellipsis:

`REACT_APP_BREWERY_DB_API_KEY = '...'`

4) With all the dependencies installed and a valid API key provided, you can now run the following command in the root directory of the project to start the app using a local server:

`npm start`

The app will run in development mode on port 3000.<br />
